#Type Inference

In JavaScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide 
type information when there is no explicit type annotation. 
For example, in this code

let x = 3;
let y = x + 3

The type of the x variable is inferred to be number. 
Similarly, the type of y variable also is inferred to be number. 
This kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, 
setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.
